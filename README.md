# Hollywood Collaboration Network Analysis

## Description
This repository contains the final project of the course on Complex Networks that I studied at UIB, Spain in my Masters. 

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation and Setup

### Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/complex-networks-project.git
$ cd complex-networks-project
```


### Set Up Python Virtual Environment
To avoid any conflicts with other Python packages, it is recommended to use a virtual environment. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

#### For Windows:
```
$ python -m venv venv
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate
```


#### For macOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```


### Install Required Packages
Install all dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running Jupyter Notebooks
To run Jupyter Notebooks, use the following command:
```
$ jupyter notebook
```

This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open a browser window where you can select and open individual notebook files.

## Usage
All the code is explained in the markdown cells within the repository.
